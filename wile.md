# 1. What is git?
```
Git is a program that records every change you make to your files.
Imagine you're writing an essay. Without git - you overwrite the same file, and if you mess something up, there's no going back. With git - every version is saved. Mess something up, you rewind. Want to see what you changed yesterday - you see it.
Basics:

You make changes to files
You tell git "remember this version" (commit)
Git takes a snapshot of the files at that moment
You can go back to any old snapshot

That's why it's used for writing code - nobody wants to lose work or be unable to roll back.
